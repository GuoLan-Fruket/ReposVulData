file.\nThis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\nAbout changelog [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)\n\n## []\n### Added\n- Demo cancer case gets loaded together with demo RD case in demo instance\n- Parse REVEL_score alongside REVEL_rankscore from csq field and display it on SNV variant page\n- Rank score results now show the ranking range\n- cDNA and protein changes displayed on institute causatives pages\n- Optional SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES configuration in app config files \n- Script to convert old OMIM case format (list of integers) to new format (list of dictionaries)\n- Additional check for user logged in status before serving alignment files\n### Changed\n- Verify user before redirecting to IGV alignments and sashimi plots\n- Build case IGV tracks starting from case and variant objects instead of passing all params in a form\n- Unfreeze Werkzeug lib since Flask_login v.0.6 with bugfix has been released\n- Sort gene panels by name (panelS and variant page)\n- Removed unused `server.blueprints.alignviewers.unindexed_remote_static` endpoint\n- User sessions to check files served by `server.blueprints.alignviewers.remote_static` endpoint\n### Fixed\n- Handle `attachment_filename` parameter renamed to `download_name` when Flask 2.2 will be released\n- Removed cursor timeout param in cases find adapter function to avoid many code warnings\n- Removed stream argument deprecation warning in tests\n- Handle `no intervals found` warning in load_region test\n\n## [4.51]\n### Added\n- Config file containing codecov settings for pull requests\n- Add an IGV.js direct link button from case page\n- Security policy file\n- Hide/shade compound variants based on rank score on variantS from filter\n- Chromograph legend documentation direct link\n### Changed\n- Updated deprecated Codecov GitHub action to v.2\n- Simplified code of scout/adapter/mongo/variant\n- Update IGV.js to v2.11.2\n- Show summary number of variant gene panels on general report if more than 3\n### Fixed\n- Marrvel link for variants in genome build 38 (using liftover to build 37)\n- Remove flags from codecov config file\n- Fixed filter bug with high negative SPIDEX scores\n- Renamed IARC TP53 button to to `TP53 Database`, modified also link since IARC has been moved to the US NCI: `https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/`\n- Parsing new format of OMIM case info when exporting patients to Matchmaker\n- Remove flask-debugtoolbar lib dependency that is using deprecated code and causes app to crash after new release of Jinja2 (3.1)\n- Variant page crashing for cases with old OMIM terms structure (a list of integers instead of dictionary)\n- Variant page crashing when creating MARRVEL link for cases with no genome build\n- SpliceAI documentation link\n- Fix deprecated `safe_str_cmp` import from `werkzeug.security` by freezing Werkzeug lib to v2.0 until Flask_login v.0.6 with bugfix is released\n- List gene names densely in general report for SVs that contain more than 3 genes\n- Show transcript ids on refseq genes on hg19 in IGV.js, using refgene source\n- Display correct number of genes in general report for SVs that contain more than 32 genes\n-
